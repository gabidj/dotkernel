# Requirements for creating a DotKernel 3 Module

DotKernel 3 modules are fairly simple to create, as they work pretty much just like a normal application.

To successfully create a Module it is important that you have a basic understanding of the following concepts:

- [Zend Expressive](https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-expressive/)
- [The recommended file structure in DotKernel 3](File-Structure.md)
- [The Routing in DotKernel 3](../Prerequisites/Routing.md)
- [The ConfigProvider](ConfigProvider.md)

One you have read these, and have a good understanding of how they work, you're ready to preceed to [creating the actual Module](Creating-a-simple-Module.md)
