# Did something just dissapear?
---

## What disappeared?
The documentation summary (or menu) disappeared.

## Why is the summary/menu hidden?
The menu is also hidden to reduce content redundancy.

## Why keeping the menu hidden instead of deleting it?
The menu is on the main page for those visitors who access this documentation through github ([see link](https://github.com/dotkernel/dotkernel/tree/master/docs))


## What does it look like?
We thought you might be curios what exactly disappeared so the menu will be presented below.

{% include menu.md %}
