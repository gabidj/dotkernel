# Introduction

In this tutorial we'll exemplify the process of creating a composer package or library to be reused in many projects. You can apply this on a new package that you are creating or when moving an existing module from a DotKernel application in order to make it reusable.

We'll use the existing contact us module that we've written in [this tutorial](https://github.com/dotkernel/dotkernel/tree/master/tutorials/creating-a-contact-us-page). Even though this is a pretty small part of the application and we'll keep it where it is in the official frontend, it's good to exemplify on it.

## Prerequisites

* follow the [Create a contact us page tutorial](https://github.com/dotkernel/dotkernel/tree/master/tutorials/creating-a-contact-us-page)
* create a new git repository where we'll keep this package
